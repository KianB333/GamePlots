Primary goal: 
- Create a website to house my insane game plots.

Secondary goal: 
- Be able to seamlessly switch between different games via a global menu
- Have easy to navigate ways of separating different plans via categories (character building, team building, other goals to work toward, etc)

Tertiary goal: 
- Make it look nice, maybe with fanart pieces of relevant characters added for visual appeal?


Layout:
--------------
Main page:
  - Name of the site (GamePlots) centered across the top
  - *Design icon (blue and yellow 'GP' fit into a circle?) for tab thumbnail/site logo
  - Top-left has three bars to indicate a menu, which has each game in a drop-down. 
    - Click on arrow to drop down for each category/major plot, or directly click name of game for page with that game's plots.
    //How to make dropdowns?
  - Body has rectangles (1.5x height of width, width for 2 max. per row) with the name of game centered on top, remainder is fanart image.
    - ^Layout will be same for every umbrella page.


Category Umbrellas:
  - Plots that are repeated/share traits with other plots are separated into categories (skyblock pet leveling, character builds, etc).

Major Plots:
  - Major plots (alchemy 50, Golden Dragon, Scatha, etc), will be their own 'category' instead of going under a category umbrella.

  * = done
